# The-Pyramid-Of-Human-Progression
The Pyramid of Human Progression is a videogame that takes a critical look at technological progression.

Humanity is always looking for technological progress, a more comfortable life,
a higher state where everything is better and more progressive. It's an eternal race to the top. 
Just like with Maslow's pyramid, we always try to find the next floor and think we can get better that way.

But is this urge justified? Where does this urge for constant development come from? 
Does our life really improve with every invention and purchase, or is this just an assumption? 
Can we as humans ever reach the top of the pyramid?

In The Great Pyramid of Human Progression, the player must view and worship 
all of humanity's technology in order to become enlightened and move up one level in the pyramid. 
But what awaits him/her at the top...
